Project Description:
Developed an interactive Import–Export Analysis Dashboard using Power BI Desktop to analyze international trade performance across multiple countries, commodities, and time periods. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into trade trends, revenue distribution, and trade balance to support data-driven decision-making.
The dataset includes country-wise, commodity-wise, and monthly trade data with key metrics such as Import Value, Export Value, Trade Balance, Quantity, Unit Price, Transport Mode, Payment Terms, and Shipment Type. Advanced DAX measures were created to calculate KPIs like Total Imports, Total Exports, Trade Balance, Growth Trends, and Top-N Products.
Interactive visuals such as KPI cards, line charts, bar charts, maps, and slicers enable users to filter data by year, country, region, commodity, transport mode, and shipment type, allowing dynamic exploration of global trade patterns.
